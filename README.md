**Case study : Multi-Account AWS EC2 Disk Utilization Monitoring**

**Background:**
You are a Solutions architect at a large enterprise that utilizes AWS cloud services. The company has grown through acquisitions and now manages 3 separate AWS accounts, each containing numerous EC2 instances. The CTO has expressed concerns about potential disk space issues across these instances and wants a comprehensive solution to monitor disk utilization.

**Assignment:**

Company is internally using a configuration management tool (Ansible). Before investing into other tools, the company has decided to use Ansible to perform the required metric collection.

Design and outline a solution to fetch and report disk utilization from all EC2 instances across the 3 AWS accounts. Your solution should address the following points:

1\. How would you centralize access and management of the 3 AWS accounts?

2\. How would you aggregate the collected data from all accounts into a single, easily digestible format?

3\. How would your solution scale if the company acquires more companies and AWS accounts in the future?

						
**Deliverables :**

1\. Provide a high-level architectural diagram of your proposed solution. 

2\.  Provide the ansible playbook

3\.  Summarize the various component involved in the process
